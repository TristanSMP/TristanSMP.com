💡 What are the best things about TristanSMP (Minecraft server)

</aside>

- John: Impossible question

> TristanSMP is a very special server and you know that for a fact. The amount of people we met on the server is amazing.
> 90% of my online friends originally came from the server. Think about it John. Even forgetting the fact amount how much people we met,
> the server is still amazing and unique.

<aside>
💡 What are the best things about TristanSMP (Discord server)

</aside>

- John: also an Impossible question

> Same as above, the amount of people we met on the server is amazing.

<aside>
💡 How can we improve the Discord Server, as you know the Discord is extremely quiet and "dead". We want to know why you don't talk to others and what we are doing wrong.

</aside>

- John: be smarter about your branding and names and all that stuff, you keep changing everything WAY too much, you also create a lot of stuff that may not even be used, leading me to believe that you are too proud of yourself, hense why you should appoint someone else to be owner with you, either that or co-owner

> I agree with you John, I really do need to improve branding. We can't really change the name of the Minecraft server (TSMP, TristanSMP)
> As we already have everyone connecting to the server using `tristansmp.com`. But I do need to stop changing things, except at the moment the server
> seems to be in a fine state. Except I've wanted to possibly add a massive 100k x 100k area very far out with pvp and no rules. Like a purge.

<aside>
💡 Do you think we should branch outside of Minecraft? As I've observed the chat and been in many conversations in the Discord I've noticed no one talks about tsmp and/or it's really rare. Most conversations are just general life. Should we become a community server and have TSMP as like a category/feature of the Discord. (Answer yes or no, describe why for bonus points)

</aside>

- John: I don't know why points would come into this application, but no, you shouldn't, instead, invent is a group of people that can brainstorm for you, way easier for you, and less actions for you, its also like having an accountant to manage your money for you

> The bonus points thing was just a little joke, I don't know why you took it so litreally. Anyways I don't really understand what you meant But
> I think we should really branch out the Discord. No one ever talks about Minecraft here anymore. Our main topics seem to be: code, music, and general life.

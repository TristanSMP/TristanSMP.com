To access this new feature, you need to have your Minecraft account linked with Natsirt so it can identify you.
If your already a TSMP Member you have already linked your account during the accepation process.

## How it works?

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ It's not as good as the old Proximity VC, but it's still better than nothing, as the old one still hasn't been updated for 1.18.

</aside>

To use the new Proximity VC, you need to do the following:

1. Make sure you have linked your Minecraft account with Natsirt.
2. Connected to the server (if you're not already connected).
3. Join the voice channel on Discord named "Connect to ProxVC"
4. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

Now when you go near another player or players in Minecraft, you will be automatically connected to the voice channel of the players you are near.

## Tips

- Mute the Notification sound when you join the voice channel. So you don't keep getting notifications when you join the voice channel.

# New Spawn

![Picture of new spawn on TSMP](https://tristansmp.com/blogimages/1-18/newspawn.png)

For the 1.18 update we have changed the spawn to be in completely new chunks, so you can explore 1.18's new biomes without having to move so far.
Typing `/spawn` will bring you to the new spawn now, while typing `/oldspawn` will bring you back to the old spawn.

# About shops...

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ As stated in our last [post](https://www.tristansmp.com/blog/new-shops), we showed off our new shop system, lets say it got a bit more complicated.

</aside>

The whole idea of _"market diamonds"_ have been soft deprecated, and we have decided to remove them from the shop system.
You can still spend _"market diamonds"_ on items, but you can't get anymore of them. From now on, you can use the old but new system which works way better.
